* Git Pull Vs Git Pull Origin
Git Pull : fetches commits from the master branch of the origin remote (into the local origin/master branch), and then it merges origin/master into the branch you currently have checked out.

Git Pull : It only works if the branch out is tracking an upstream branch.
